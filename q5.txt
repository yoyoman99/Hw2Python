2.Yes
3. Since variable a is pointing to the integer, you can not change
it in the function increment_int_a. However, variable b is a list and
you can change the first element using increment_int_b. So you can not
use this increment function to change a variable of an integer, but
you can change the elements in a list that the variable is pointing
to instead.
